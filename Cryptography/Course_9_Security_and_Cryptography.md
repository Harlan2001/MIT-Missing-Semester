### Entropy.
1.Suppose a password is chosen as a concatenation of four lower-case dictionary words, where each word is selected uniformly at random from a dictionary of size 100,000. An example of such a password is correcthorsebatterystaple. How many bits of entropy does this have?

2.Consider an alternative scheme where a password is chosen as a sequence of 8 random alphanumeric characters (including both lower-case and upper-case letters). An example is rg8Ql34g. How many bits of entropy does this have?

3.Which is the stronger password?

4.Suppose an attacker can try guessing 10,000 passwords per second. On average, how long will it take to break each of the passwords?
### 2.Cryptographic hash functions. Download a Debian image from a mirror (e.g. from this Argentinean mirror). Cross-check the hash (e.g. using the sha256sum command) with the hash retrieved from the official Debian site (e.g. this file hosted at debian.org, if youâ€™ve downloaded the linked file from the Argentinean mirror).
### 3.Symmetric cryptography. Encrypt a file with AES encryption, using OpenSSL: openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -in {input filename} -out {output filename}. Look at the contents using cat or hexdump. Decrypt it with openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in {input filename} -out {output filename} and confirm that the contents match the original using cmp.
### 4.Asymmetric cryptography.

1.Set up SSH keys on a computer you have access to (not Athena, because Kerberos interacts weirdly with SSH keys). Make sure your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, so it is protected at rest.

2.Set up GPG

3.Send Anish an encrypted email (public key).

4.Sign a Git commit with git commit -S or create a signed Git tag with git tag -s. Verify the signature on the commit with git show --show-signature or on the tag with git tag -v.
